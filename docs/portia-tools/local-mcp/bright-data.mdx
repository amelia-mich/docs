# Bright Data

### Description

Integrates with Bright Data's web scraping infrastructure to provide real-time access to public web data through specialized tools for search engine scraping, webpage extraction, and structured data retrieval from popular websites.

Visit the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization

To use this MCP server, you need to need API credentials in your environment. Please refer to the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) for more information.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="Bright Data",
    command="npx",
    args=["@brightdata/mcp"],
    env={"API_TOKEN": "<api_token>"},
)
                    
```

<details>
<summary>Complete example</summary>

Equip your `Portia` instance with the tools from the MCP server, in addition to the default tools from the `DefaultToolRegistry`:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="Bright Data",
    command="npx",
    args=["@brightdata/mcp"],
    env={"API_TOKEN": "<api_token>"},
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
