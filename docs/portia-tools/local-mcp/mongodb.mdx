# MongoDB

### Description

Provides a bridge between MongoDB databases and conversational interfaces, enabling comprehensive database operations, collection management, schema inspection, and Atlas cloud service interactions with authentication and telemetry support.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="mongodb",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--connectionString", "<connection_string>"],
)
                    
```
