# Stripe

### Description

Integrates with Stripe's API to enable payment processing, customer management, and financial operations for e-commerce and billing workflows.

### Authorization


To use this MCP server, you need to need API credentials in your environment.


### Usage

Remote MCP servers are available in the Portia cloud dashboard.

After you have [created your Portia account (↗)](/setup-account), you can enable the server via the [Portia cloud tool registry (↗)](/cloud-tool-registry). You will be requested to provide your API key when you enable the server.

Once enabled, set your Portia API key in your environment and the tools will be available to use in the `DefaultToolRegistry`.

Listing the tools with the CLI:
```bash
$ PORTIA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> portia-cli list-tools
```

Using the `DefaultToolRegistry` in your code:
```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
portia = Portia(config=config, tools=DefaultToolRegistry(config))
```
