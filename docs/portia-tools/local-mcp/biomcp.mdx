# BioMCP

### Description

Integrates with biomedical databases including ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and MyVariant.info to provide structured access to clinical trials, research articles, and genetic variants with intelligent data rendering and source attribution.

Visit the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/genomoncology/biomcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorisation

This server does not require any extra authentication to use.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="biomcp",
    command="uv",
    args=["run", "--with", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"],
)
                    
```

<summary>Complete example</summary>

Equip your `Portia` instance with the tools from the MCP server, in addition to the default tools from the `DefaultToolRegistry`:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="biomcp",
    command="uv",
    args=["run", "--with", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"],
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
