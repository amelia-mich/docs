# BioMCP

### Description

Integrates with biomedical databases including ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and MyVariant.info to provide structured access to clinical trials, research articles, and genetic variants with intelligent data rendering and source attribution.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/genomoncology/biomcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization

This server does not require any authentication other than what is in the MCP server URL.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
from portia import McpToolRegistry

McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="biomcp",
    command="uv",
    args=["run", "--with", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"],
)
                    
```

    server_name="biomcp",
    command="uv",
    args=["run", "--with", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"],
)
                    

config = Config.from_default()
