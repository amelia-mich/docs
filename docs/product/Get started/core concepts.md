# Core concepts
Portia AI allows you to run multi-agent, stateful, authenticated workflows in response to a user prompt.

## Intro
With our open source capabilities you should be able to:
- Ingest a user query and augment it with our pre-defined system prompting to generate a structured plan.
- Execute a workflow based on a structured plan, invoking the relevant tools and updating the workflow state at every step.
- Build your own tools.
- Create clarifications to interrupt a workflow and solicit human input when necessary, e.g. to handle required authentication or missing input.

Our cloud offering works seamlessly with our open source library. It will give you the ability to:
- Store and retrieve workflow states and review historical workflow logs.
- Invoke a library of cloud-hosted tools with authentication handled for you, and access tool call logs.


## Core abstractions
Let's examine the core concepts more closely before delving into some hands on examples.

| Abstraction | Purpose | Features |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Plan | A plan is the immutable series of steps generated by an LLM in response to a user prompt. It is the blueprint that workflow runs are based on. | Because plans are structured using Portia's plan definition syntax, they are easy to parse and share in a user-friendly format.<br/> You may want to create some of those plans yourself manually, especially to cater for your users' more repeatable routines.<br/> A plan includes a series of steps defined by <ul><li>A task describing the objective of that particular step.</li><li>The inputs required to achieve the step.</li><li>Any relevant tool needed for its completion</li><li>The step's final output.</li></ul> PS: While plans are currently a linear sequence of steps, we will be introducing more complex workflow logic soon. |
| Workflow | A workflow is a unique instantiation of a plan. It essentially represents a run of the plan. | A new agent is spun up to handle every step of a workflow during its execution. The state of a workflow is updated at the end of every step. This includes: <ul><li>A workflow step index tracking where we are in the execution.</li><li>The actual workflow state i.e. NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE or NEED_CLARIFICATION.</li><li>A list of step outputs that is populated throughout the workflow execution.</li><li>A list of instances where human input was solicited during workflow execution (clarifications, see below).</li></ul> |
| Clarification | Clarifications allow you to pause a workflow mid-execution to obtain human input in a structured way. | You can use clarifications to get a user to provide a missing input, perform authentication or pick a preferred option from a list.<br/> We have designed clarifications to be structured so you can easily extend beyond those formats and render clarifications to your users in other ways e.g. getting them to complete a complicated form.
