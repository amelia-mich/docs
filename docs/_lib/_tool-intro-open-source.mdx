## Usage

Portia offers both open source tools as well as a cloud-hosted library of tools to save you development time. You can dig into the specs of those tools in our open source repo (<a href="https://github.com/portiaAI/portia-sdk-python/tree/main/portia/open_source_tools" target="_blank">**SDK repo ↗**</a>).

You can import our open source tools into your project using `from portia.open_source_tools.registry import open_source_tool_registry` and load them into an `InMemoryToolRegistry` object. You can also combine their use with cloud or custom tools as explained in the docs (<a href="/add-custom-tools" target="_blank">**Add custom tools ↗**</a>).
