# Browser Use Tool

<Intro />

## Tool details
**Tool ID:** `browser_tool`

**Tool description:** General purpose browser tool. Can be used to navigate to a URL and complete tasks. Should only be used if the task requires a browser and you are sure of the URL. This tool handles a full end to end task. DO NOT break a single task into multiple browser tool steps as each step is run in an independent new session!

**Usage notes:**

Also see the <a href='/SDK/portia/open_source_tools/browser_tool#browsertoolforurl-objects'>BrowserToolForUrl tool</a>, which you can initialise with a URL to run your browser tasks from.
