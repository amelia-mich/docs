      "description": "When using the Slack Find Message tool to search for             messages you have to adhere to the query string structure             of slack strictly. In addition to whatever keywords are             relevant from the user's prompt, follow the guidelines             below to build the query string and never ever add anything             other than that.             To look for messages from a specific user you have to refer             to their slack user name using @ in the query string             like so: 'from:@UserName' e.g. 'from:@nathan' to get             messages from nathan.             To look for messages sent to me or someone else you have to             refer to their Slack username using @ in the query string             like so: 'to:@UserName' e.g. 'to:@mounir'.             Next, and this should ONLY be used if the user is asking             about messages in a specific channel, to look for messages             in a specific channel you have to insert 'in:ChannelName'             in the query string e.g. 'in:social'",
