# Manage your config
Configure your LLM and override system prompts. Select different plan and workflow storage options.

:::tip[TL:DR]
here be tldr
:::

## Configure LLM options
- API key
- LLM choice
- Prompts -- IS THIS SUPPORTED YET? --> Do an example with Planner prompt e.g. for a different plan design language?

## Manage storage options
- Storage types
- Plan and workflow storage --> Do an example with local plan and workflow storage (I have one already)
