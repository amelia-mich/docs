# Hyperbrowser

### Description

Enables web browsing capabilities through tools for content extraction, link following, and browser automation with customizable parameters for scraping, data collection, and web crawling tasks.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/hyperbrowserai/mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="hyperbrowser",
    command="npx",
    args=[
        "-y",
        "hyperbrowser-mcp",
    ],
    env={"HYPERBROWSER_API_KEY": "<api_key>"},
)
                    
```
