# Basic Memory

### Description

Knowledge management system that builds a persistent semantic graph in markdown, locally.

Visit the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization

This server does not require any extra authentication to use.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="basic-memory",
    command="uvx",
    args=[
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp",
    ],
)
                    
```

<summary>Complete example</summary>

Equip your `Portia` instance with the tools from the MCP server, in addition to the default tools from the `DefaultToolRegistry`:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="basic-memory",
    command="uvx",
    args=[
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp",
    ],
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
