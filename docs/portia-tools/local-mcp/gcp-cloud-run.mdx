# GCP Cloud Run

### Description

Deploys applications to Google Cloud Run through automated containerization, project setup, and service management with support for both local files and provided content.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/cloud-run-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization


To use this MCP server, you need to need API credentials in your environment. Please refer to the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/cloud-run-mcp) for more information.


### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="cloud-run-mcp",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-mcp"],
)
                    
```

Extending the tool set in the `DefaultToolRegistry` with the local MCP server:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="cloud-run-mcp",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-mcp"],
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
