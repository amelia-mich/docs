# Shopify

### Description

Integrates with individual Shopify stores to enable product catalog search, cart management, and policy inquiries for complete shopping experiences from discovery to checkout.

### Authorization

This server does not require any authentication, other than the MCP server URL.

### Usage

Remote MCP servers are available in the Portia cloud dashboard.

After you have [created your Portia account (↗)](/setup-account), you can enable the server via the [Portia cloud tool registry (↗)](/cloud-tool-registry).

Once enabled, set your Portia API key in your environment and the tools will be available to use in the `DefaultToolRegistry`.

Listing the tools with the CLI:
```bash
$ PORTIA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> portia-cli list-tools
```

Using the `DefaultToolRegistry` in your code:
```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
portia = Portia(config=config, tools=DefaultToolRegistry(config))
```
