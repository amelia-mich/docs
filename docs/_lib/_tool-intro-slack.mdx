## Configure your Slack tools with Portia AI
You will need to create your own Slack App to use with Portia AI. This is so you can control the name and appearance of slack bot activity initiated via the Portia AI framework. Once your slack app is created you can configure your client ID and secret in the Portia dashboard.

### Install a Slack app
1. Head over to <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps" target="_blank">**api.slack.com/apps ↗**</a>
2. Create an app from scratch and select the Slack workplace you would like to use it in.
3. Note down the client ID and secret on the **Basic Information** page. We will need this in a couple of steps from now!
4. In the **OAuth & Permissions** tab further down in the left hand nav, add as **Redirect URL** the following URL `https://api.portialabs.ai/api/v0/oauth/slack` (don't forget to hit that **Save URLs** button!).
5. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, be sure to add the scopes
    - `channels:history` -- View messages and other content in public channels that your Slack app has been added to.
    - `channels:read` -- View basic information about public channels in a workspace.
    - `chat:write` -- Send messages as *@\{your slack app name\}*.
    - `users:read` -- View people in a workspace.
6. Under **User Token Scopes**, be sure to add the scope `search:read` to support searching workplace content.
7. Now scroll up to the top of the **OAuth & Permissions** page and hit the **Install to *\{your workplace name\}*** button.
8. Once that is done, open your Slack app and hit 'Add apps` and be sure to select your new app.

### Configure access in Portia AI
1. Log into your Portia <a href="https://app.portialabs.ai" target="_blank">**dashboard ↗**</a>
2. Navigate to the **Manage Org** tab.
3. Enter the client ID and secret of your Slack app as collected in step 3 of the Slack installation process above.

You are now ready to call Slack tools on our cloud!
