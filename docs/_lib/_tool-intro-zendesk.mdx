## Configure your Zendesk tools with Portia AI

You will need to provide the subdomain of your Zendesk account to use with Portia AI. This is because Zendesk creates a unique subdomain for each account.

### Configure access in Portia AI

1. Log into your Portia <a href="https://app.portialabs.ai" target="_blank">**dashboard â†—**</a>
2. Navigate to the **Manage Org** tab.
3. Enter the subdomain of your Zendesk account. Your subdomain is the part of your Zendesk URL before the `.zendesk.com` domain. For example, if your Zendesk URL is `https://portialabs.zendesk.com`, your subdomain is `portialabs`.

You are now ready to call Zendesk tools on our cloud!
