# Xero

### Description

Provides a bridge to the Xero accounting API, enabling financial data interactions and accounting operations through OAuth2 custom connections for automated workflow management.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/xeroapi/xero-mcp-server) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="xero",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={
        "XERO_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "XERO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
    },
)
                    
```
