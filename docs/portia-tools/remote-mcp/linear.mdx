# Linear

### Description

Access your Linear data to manage your projects and issues in a simple and secure way.

### Authorization

This server uses OAuth2 for authentication. When an end-user uses a tool from this server, they will be redirected to the server's login page.

### Usage

Remote MCP servers are available in the Portia cloud dashboard.

After you have [created your Portia account (↗)](/setup-account), you can enable the server via the [Portia cloud tool registry (↗)](/cloud-tool-registry). You will be requested to authorize with the server via OAuth when you enable it.

Once enabled, set your Portia API key in your environment and the tools will be available to use in the `DefaultToolRegistry`.

Listing the tools with the CLI:
```bash
$ PORTIA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> portia-cli list-tools
```

Using the `DefaultToolRegistry` in your code:
```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
portia = Portia(config=config, tools=DefaultToolRegistry(config))
```
