# LLM Tool

<Intro />

## Tool details
**Tool ID:** `llm_tool`

**Tool description:** Jack of all trades tool to respond to a prompt by relying solely on LLM capabilities. YOU NEVER CALL OTHER TOOLS. You use your native capabilities as an LLM only. This includes using your general knowledge, your in-built reasoning and your code interpreter capabilities. This tool can be used to summarize the outputs of other tools, make general language model queries or to answer questions. This should be used only as a last resort when no other tool satisfies a step in a task, however if there are no other tools that can be used to complete a step or for steps that don't require a tool call, this SHOULD be used
