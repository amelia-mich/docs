# Browser Use Tool

<Intro />

## Tool details
**Tool ID:** `browser_tool`

**Tool description:** General purpose browser tool. Can be used to navigate to a URL and complete tasks. Should only be used if the task requires a browser and you are sure of the URL. This tool handles a full end to end task. It is capable of doing multiple things across different URLs within the same root domain as part of the end to end task. As a result, do not call this tool more than once back to back unless it is for different root domains - just call it once with the combined task and the URL set to the root domain.

**Usage notes:**

Also see the <a href='/SDK/portia/open_source_tools/browser_tool#browsertoolforurl-objects'>BrowserToolForUrl tool</a>, which you can initialise with a URL to run your browser tasks from.
