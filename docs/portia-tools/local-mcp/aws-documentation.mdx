# AWS Documentation

### Description

Provides tools to access AWS documentation, search for content, and get recommendations.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/HEAD/src/aws-documentation-mcp-server) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="aws-docs",
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
)
                    
```
