# Super memory

### Description

Personal knowledge platform that helps collect, organize, and recall information from various sources with end-to-end encryption and optional self-hosting.

### Authorization

This server does not require any extra authentication to use, other than the MCP server URL.

### Usage

Remote MCP servers are available in the Portia cloud dashboard.

After you have [created your Portia account (↗)](/setup-account), you can enable the server via the [Portia cloud tool registry (↗)](/cloud-tool-registry).

Once enabled, set your Portia API key in your environment and the tools will be available to use in the `DefaultToolRegistry`.

Listing the tools with the CLI:
```bash
$ PORTIA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> portia-cli list-tools
```

Using the `DefaultToolRegistry` in your code:
```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
portia = Portia(config=config, tools=DefaultToolRegistry(config))
```
