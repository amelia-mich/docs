# Monday.com

### Description

Integrates with monday.com API to enable direct access to boards, workflows, and data for automating tasks and managing resources without context switching.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp/tree/HEAD/packages/monday-api-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="monday.com",
    command="npx",
    args=[
        "@mondaydotcomorg/monday-api-mcp",
        "-t",
        "<api_key>",
    ],
)
                    
```
