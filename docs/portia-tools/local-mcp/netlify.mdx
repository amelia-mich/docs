# Netlify

### Description

Integrates with Netlify's platform for complete site management including project operations, deployments with zip uploads, team administration, extension configuration, and documentation access across hosting, build, and collaboration workflows.

Visit the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization


To use this MCP server, you need to need API credentials in your environment. Please refer to the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-mcp) for more information.


### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="netlify",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@netlify/mcp"],
    env={
        "NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<api_key>",
    },
)
                    
```

Extending the tool set in the `DefaultToolRegistry` with the local MCP server:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="netlify",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@netlify/mcp"],
    env={
        "NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<api_key>",
    },
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
