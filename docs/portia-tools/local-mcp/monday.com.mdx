# Monday.com

### Description

Integrates with monday.com API to enable direct access to boards, workflows, and data for automating tasks and managing resources without context switching.

Visit the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp/tree/HEAD/packages/monday-api-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Authorization

To use this MCP server, you need to need API credentials in your environment. Please refer to the [server homepage (↗)](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp/tree/HEAD/packages/monday-api-mcp) for more information.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="monday.com",
    command="npx",
    args=[
        "@mondaydotcomorg/monday-api-mcp",
        "-t",
        "<api_key>",
    ],
)
                    
```

<details>
<summary>Complete example</summary>

Equip your `Portia` instance with the tools from the MCP server, in addition to the default tools from the `DefaultToolRegistry`:

```python
from portia import DefaultToolRegistry, McpToolRegistry, Portia, Config

config = Config.from_default()
tool_registry = DefaultToolRegistry(config) +  McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="monday.com",
    command="npx",
    args=[
        "@mondaydotcomorg/monday-api-mcp",
        "-t",
        "<api_key>",
    ],
)
                    

portia = Portia(config=config, tools=tool_registry)
```
