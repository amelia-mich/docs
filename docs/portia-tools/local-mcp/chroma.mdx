# Chroma

### Description

Integrates with Chroma vector database to enable collection management, document operations, and vector search capabilities for knowledge bases and context-aware conversations.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="chroma-mcp",
    command="uvx",
    args=["chroma-mcp", "--client-type", "persistent", "--data-dir", "/path/to/chroma/"],
)
                    
```
