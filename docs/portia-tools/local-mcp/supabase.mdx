# Supabase

### Description

Connects directly to Supabase projects for managing databases, executing SQL queries, applying migrations, and handling configurations through natural language commands.

Visit the [server homepage ↗](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp) for more information about how to use this MCP server.

### Usage

To use this MCP server in your Portia project, you need to create an `McpToolRegistry` instance and pass it to the `Portia` constructor.

```python
McpToolRegistry.from_stdio_connection(
    server_name="supabase",
    command="npx",
    args=[
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--read-only",
        "--project-ref=<project_ref>",
    ],
    env={"SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<personal_access_token>"},
)
                    
```
